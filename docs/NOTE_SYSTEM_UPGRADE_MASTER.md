# Brain Note System Upgrade: Master Documentation Index
*Last Updated: 2025-01-03*

## Overview
This document serves as the master index for all documentation related to the Brain + Obsidian integration project. The upgrade transforms Brain from a simple key-value store into an intelligent knowledge management system by integrating with Obsidian.

## Project Status
- **Phase**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation
- **Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
- **Priority**: High
- **Risk Level**: Low (with isolation strategy)

## Core Documentation

### 1. Analysis Documents (Current State)
- [CURRENT_NOTE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md](./CURRENT_NOTE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md) - Comprehensive analysis of how notes are currently taken, stored, and retrieved
- [NOTE_SYSTEM_TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md](./NOTE_SYSTEM_TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md) - Technical deep-dive into database schema and implementation
- [NOTE_SYSTEM_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md](./NOTE_SYSTEM_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md) - Discovery of multi-tier storage system
- [NOTE_SYSTEM_USAGE_PATTERNS.md](./NOTE_SYSTEM_USAGE_PATTERNS.md) - Real-world usage examples and patterns
- [NOTE_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md](./NOTE_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md) - Executive summary of all analyses

### 2. Planning Documents (Future State)
These documents should be created in the docs directory:

#### Phase 1: Initial Engineering Plan
- `NOTE_SYSTEM_ENGINEERING_PLAN_V1.md` - Initial comprehensive plan proposing 8-week Brain enhancement

#### Phase 2: Revised Obsidian Integration Plan  
- `BRAIN_OBSIDIAN_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Pivoted to 3-week Obsidian integration approach
- Includes detailed API specifications, vault structure, and workflows

#### Phase 3: Final Engineering Plan (Post-Reviews)
- `BRAIN_OBSIDIAN_FINAL_PLAN.md` - Incorporates Gemini's strategic refinements
- Adds bidirectional sync, automated daemons, AI philosophy

#### Phase 4: Enhancement Roadmap
- `BRAIN_OBSIDIAN_ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Prioritized enhancements from DeepSeek R1
- Four priority tiers with specific implementation details

#### Phase 5: Execution Tool Isolation Strategy
- `BRAIN_DEVELOPMENT_ISOLATION_PLAN.md` - Critical safeguards for protecting execution tool
- Complete separation architecture and monitoring

## Key Decisions

### Architecture
1. **Obsidian as Source of Truth** - All permanent notes stored as markdown files
2. **Brain as Intelligent Index** - Fast, AI-enriched metadata layer (300-node LRU cache)
3. **Bidirectional Sync** - Changes in either system propagate automatically
4. **Complete Isolation** - Note system development cannot impact execution tools

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Obsidian (free, local-first markdown editor)
- **Backend**: Brain MCP server (existing SQLite + new tools)
- **Sync**: Obsidian plugin (preferred) or file watcher
- **Search**: Unified tool combining FTS5 + Obsidian files

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Week 1**: Core integration tools + bidirectional sync
2. **Week 2**: Intelligence layer + automated daemons  
3. **Week 3**: Workflows + optimization
4. **Week 4+**: Advanced features

## Critical Requirements

### Non-Negotiable
1. Brain execution tool remains 100% operational
2. All data remains local (no cloud dependencies)
3. Markdown files portable (no vendor lock-in)
4. Graceful degradation (system remains useful if parts fail)

### Success Metrics
- Sync accuracy: 99.9%
- Search performance: <200ms
- Knowledge building: 10+ permanent notes/week
- Connection density: 5+ links per note

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Development
- [ ] Set up Obsidian vault at `/Users/bard/BrainVault/`
- [ ] Create `/brain-notes/` isolated development directory
- [ ] Implement execution tool monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up automated testing framework
- [ ] Create database backup system

### Week 1 Tasks
- [ ] Build `obsidian_note` tool with all CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement `unified_search` combining both systems
- [ ] Create file system watcher for sync
- [ ] Add file locking mechanism
- [ ] Set up metadata cache

### Week 2 Tasks
- [ ] Implement system daemons (auto-sync, index rebuild)
- [ ] Build `brain_analyze` with connection proposals
- [ ] Create relationship detector
- [ ] Add conflict resolution
- [ ] Update Claude's system message

### Week 3 Tasks
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User documentation
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Final testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Corruption** → WAL + checksums + hot-swap replicas
2. **Sync Conflicts** → Version vectors + semantic detection
3. **Performance** → LRU-K cache + metadata indexing
4. **Execution Impact** → Complete isolation + circuit breakers

### Rollback Plan
```bash
/brain/docs/scripts/emergency_rollback.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this master document and linked analyses
2. **Create** the planning documents in the docs directory
3. **Set up** development environment per isolation plan
4. **Begin** Week 1 implementation with `obsidian_note` tool

## Questions for Implementation Team

1. Should we use Obsidian plugin or file watcher for sync?
2. What's the preferred conflict resolution strategy?
3. Should we implement all Priority 1 enhancements in Week 1?
4. Do we need additional monitoring beyond the dashboard?

## Document Maintenance

This master document should be updated:
- After each week's sprint completion
- When major decisions are made
- When new risks are identified
- When success metrics are achieved
