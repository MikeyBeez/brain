# Brain Development Chronicle

## Purpose
Track the actual history of building Brain - decisions made, problems encountered, solutions found. This is the PROJECT'S story, not a usage manual.

## Current State
- Phase: 0 (Pre-implementation)
- Last Action: Created engineering specification
- Next Goal: Bootstrap memory loop

## Session Log

### Session 0: Planning Complete
- Created comprehensive engineering spec
- Identified bootstrapping challenge
- Decision: Start with minimal memory loop (remember/recall only)

---

[Sessions will be added as development progresses]

## Key Decisions Record

### Why SQLite over JSON files
- Date: [Planning phase]
- Context: Needed reliable concurrent access
- Decision: SQLite with JSON columns
- Rationale: Best of both worlds - reliability + flexibility

---

## Problems & Solutions

[To be filled as encountered]

## Bootstrap Sequence (Project-Specific)

The exact order we're building Brain:
1. Git repository initialization
2. Core database module
3. Remember/recall tools
4. MCP server skeleton
5. First successful memory loop
6. [Continue...]
