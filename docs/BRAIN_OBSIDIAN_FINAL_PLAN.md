# Brain + Obsidian Integration: Final Engineering Plan
*Incorporating Gemini's Strategic Refinements*

## Executive Summary

This document presents the final engineering plan for integrating the Brain system with Obsidian, incorporating strategic refinements from the review process. The core insight is to treat **Obsidian as the Source of Truth** for knowledge content, while **Brain serves as an Intelligent Index & Context Cache** - a high-speed, AI-enriched metadata layer.

**Key Enhancement**: The plan now includes bidirectional synchronization, automated maintenance daemons, and a clear philosophy for AI-guided knowledge management.

## Architectural Philosophy

### The Index Metaphor (Strategic Refinement)
- **Obsidian Vault**: The permanent, authoritative source of all knowledge (markdown files)
- **Brain SQLite DB**: A fast, intelligent, but ultimately rebuildable index with:
  - Hot session context (300-node LRU cache)
  - AI-enriched metadata
  - Relationship graphs
  - Full-text search index
  - Can be rebuilt from the Vault if necessary

This reframing makes the 300-node limit a feature, not a bug - it's an LRU cache for the most relevant ideas.
