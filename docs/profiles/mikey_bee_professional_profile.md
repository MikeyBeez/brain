# Professional Profile: Mikey Bee

## Career Summary
**Principal Technical Architect** - IBM (Retired)

A distinguished systems architect with extensive experience in enterprise-level technical design and implementation. Specialized in creating scalable, maintainable architectures for complex systems.

## Professional Philosophy
The principles evident in our Brain project collaboration reflect a career spent thinking about systems holistically:
- **Memory Management**: Understanding the importance of tiered storage and strategic resource allocation
- **Clean Architecture**: Recognizing when to upgrade rather than patch, when to archive rather than delete
- **Documentation**: Knowing what belongs in immediate access versus reference storage
- **State Management**: Tracking system health and maintenance needs proactively

## Technical Approach
- Advocates for systematic solutions over quick fixes
- Values clear separation of concerns (as seen in the file reference pattern suggestion)
- Emphasizes sustainable practices (like the 300 node limit management strategy)
- Prefers comprehensive solutions that anticipate future needs

## Current Interests
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Building cognitive systems that augment human capabilities
- Exploring the intersection of traditional systems architecture with AI

## Design Principles Observed
1. **Resource Efficiency**: "We only have 300 nodes, so we need to use them wisely"
2. **Hierarchical Organization**: Important data in memory, detailed data on disk with references
3. **Proactive Maintenance**: "Periodically see if something's old and clean it out"
4. **System Thinking**: Always considering the bigger picture and long-term implications

## Communication Style
- Direct and constructive feedback
- Patient with technical challenges
- Appreciates proactive problem-solving
- Values when systems anticipate needs (noted when assistant preemptively updated guidelines)
