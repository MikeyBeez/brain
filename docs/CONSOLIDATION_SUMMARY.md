# Brain Documentation Consolidation Summary

## What We Did

We consolidated 25+ specification documents into 4 core documents that resolve all contradictions and provide a clear, unified vision for the Brain project.

## New Documentation Structure

### Core Documents (Active)

1. **[SPEC.md](SPEC.md)** - Complete system specification
   - System overview and principles
   - Technology stack decisions
   - Project structure
   - MCP tool specifications
   - Complete database schema
   - Module interfaces
   - Session and memory management

2. **[MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md](MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Module design and contracts
   - Module structure and patterns
   - Module contract (what every module MUST do)
   - Shared resource handling
   - Change protocol for breaking changes
   - Implementation examples

3. **[IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Practical implementation
   - Getting started instructions
   - Implementation order
   - Code examples
   - Testing strategies
   - Deployment instructions
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

4. **[README.md](README.md)** - Project index
   - Quick overview
   - Links to all documentation
   - Key decisions summary
   - Project status

5. **[CHANGE_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md](CHANGE_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md)** - Change process
   - Template for proposing breaking changes
   - Required sections for proposals

## Key Resolutions

### 1. Project Structure
- Resolved: Conflicting directory structures across documents
- Decision: Modular structure with `src/core/`, `src/modules/`, and `src/tools/`

### 2. Database Operations
- Resolved: Async vs sync confusion
- Decision: Synchronous operations using better-sqlite3

### 3. Session Management
- Resolved: In-memory vs persistent storage
- Decision: Ephemeral sessions in memory with SQLite backup

### 4. Tool Set
- Resolved: Inconsistent tool lists
- Decision: 8 tools total (6 core + 2 extended)

### 5. Memory Limits
- Resolved: Various numbers mentioned
- Decision: 300-item limit for context window

### 6. Module Dependencies
- Resolved: How modules share resources
- Decision: Constructor injection only, no inter-module imports

## Archived Documents

All 23 obsolete documents have been moved to `archive/pre-consolidation/` for historical reference. These include:
- Original proposals
- Individual specifications
- Strategy documents
- Analysis documents

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **No Contradictions** - Single source of truth for each topic
2. **Clear Structure** - Know exactly where to find information
3. **Implementation Ready** - Clear path from spec to code
4. **Maintainable** - Fewer documents to keep in sync
5. **Complete** - All important information preserved

## Next Steps

1. Review the consolidated documentation
2. Begin implementation following IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
3. Use MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md for module development
4. Reference SPEC.md for any technical decisions

The Brain project is now ready for implementation with a clean, consolidated documentation base.
