# Brain Project Plan

## Overview & Goals
**Project**: Brain - Persistent Memory System for Claude
**Purpose**: Provide Claude with persistent memory across sessions via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
**Vision**: An intelligent external memory that compresses and retrieves information like human memory

## Current Status (June 30, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Core system operational
- ‚úÖ MCP integration complete
- ‚úÖ Execution transparency implemented
- üîÑ Code usage analyzer integrated into Monitex
- ‚è≥ Optimization phase beginning

## Key Milestones
- [x] **M1**: Basic MCP server with SQLite storage (Complete)
- [x] **M2**: Core tools implemented (init, remember, recall, status) (Complete)
- [x] **M3**: Execution monitoring with full transparency (Complete)
- [x] **M4**: Code usage analyzer for optimization (Complete)
- [ ] **M5**: Remove 80% of unused code (July 2025)
- [ ] **M6**: Intelligent memory compression (August 2025)
- [ ] **M7**: Pattern detection and suggestions (September 2025)

## Dependencies
- Node.js v24.3.0 (critical - native modules compiled against this)
- SQLite3 with better-sqlite3
- TypeScript for type safety
- Monitex for unified monitoring

## Resource Requirements
- **Storage**: ~400KB database, growing slowly
- **Memory**: <50MB runtime
- **CPU**: Minimal - async operations
- **Ports**: 9997 (analyzer), 9998 (execution API), MCP stdio

## Success Metrics
1. **Performance**: All operations <100ms
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
3. **Efficiency**: Stay under 300 node context limit
4. **Code Reduction**: From 10,000 to <2,000 files
5. **User Satisfaction**: Seamless memory persistence

## Risk Factors
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Context limit overflow | High | Aggressive compression strategies |
| Database corruption | High | WAL mode + regular backups |
| Version mismatches | Medium | Strict version pinning |
| Memory bloat | Medium | Tiered storage with cleanup |

## Team & Responsibilities
- **Mikey Bee**: Project owner, primary user
- **Claude**: Implementation, optimization, documentation

## Next Actions
1. Run usage analyzer for 24 hours
2. Review and delete unused code
3. Create automated memory compression
4. Document optimization results
